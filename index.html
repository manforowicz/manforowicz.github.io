<h2>Book Recommendations</h2>
<p>All of these books have helped me understand the forest instead of just seeing the trees.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722">The Righteous Mind</a> - Jonathan Haidt, Simona Drelciuc</h3>
<p>Humans have evolved a gut feeling to judge things as moral or immoral.
How does our moral compass work, and what evolutionary purpose does it serve?
How does it fuel varying political views?</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook">The Dictator's Handbook</a> - Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith</h3>
<p>Why do countries with more natural resources tend to have lower standards of living? Why are some countries rich and others poor? What prevents democracies from turning into dictatorships?</p>
<p>World events are often explained by analyzing the ideologies and beliefs of countries. I find this unconvincing. I mean, what does it mean for an abstract entity called a country to have motives, ideas, and thoughts?</p>
<p>This book takes a very different approach, and explains the structure of power through the lens of game theory.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39644188">Order Without Design</a> - Alain Bertaud</h3>
<p>Cities spontaneously form because living closer to others allows the efficient exchange of labor, goods, and ideas. What factors and incentives influence things like population density, building height, and housing costs? Why are cities in different countries so different? How do government attempts to regulate how cities grow influence their structure? Read this book to find out!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1909043">Negotiation Genius</a> - Deepak Malhotra, Max H. Bazerman</h3>
<p>Two parties with different goals, motives, and incentives, come to the negotiation table. How can they come to a mutually beneficial agreement?</p>
<p>This book derives a comprehensive framework for analyzing negotiations and creating shared value that benefits both parties. The art of negotiation is so much more than just back-and-forth haggling.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50878951">How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor</a> - Colin Tucker</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how a nuclear reactor works? How do they reliably and safely satisfy over 10% of the world's electricity needs? This book, written by a reactor operator, strikes the perfect balance between dumbed-down and too-technical.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3028">Economics in One Lesson</a> - Henry Hazlitt</h3>
<p>Disclaimer: This book doesn't teach economic analysis.
Written in 1946, it's a rant against certain economic policies.
Treat this book with a grain of salt, because unlike the others listed here, it's quite one-sided.</p>
<p>That said, I highly recommend reading it to develop a well-rounded understanding of laissez-faire economics.
It makes well-articulated and thought-provoking arguments against certain forms of government intervention.
Read it with an open mind, and you'll have a lot to think about!</p>
