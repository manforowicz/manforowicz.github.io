        <h1>Marcin's Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Marcin Anforowicz. I enjoy working on projects that combine software, creativity, and engineering.</p>

<p>I'm a certified amateur radio operator since 2019 (callsign: KJ7JCN).
I enjoy exploring creative radio protocols such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)">WSPR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Radio_Linking_Project">IRLP</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">APRS</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy making websites for student organizations at the University of Washington. I maintain the websites of <a href="https://huskysat.org/team">Husky Satellite Lab</a> (<a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat/hsl-website">code</a>) and <a href="https://uw-programming.netlify.app/">Competitive Programming Club</a> (<a href="https://github.com/manforowicz/uwcp-site">code</a>).</p>
<p>I teach others how to build and fly remote-controlled airplanes at the drone team of Husky Flying Club at the University of Washington. Here are some pictures and videos from that:</p>

<p>My favorite programming language is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust</a>. I'm working on a peer-to-peer file transfer project called <a href="https://github.com/manforowicz/gday">gday</a>. It's still in an early phase of development.</p>

<p>I enjoy making educational YouTube videos such as <em>The Just One More Paradox</em> (see below).
I made this video before I had any formal education in probability, so the explanations aren't very rigorous, but all the concepts still hold.
I <a href="https://github.com/manforowicz/Manim-Videos">programmed the animations</a> for this video using <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a>, an open source visualization library.</p>

<p>I'm an active member of Husky Satellite Lab. Currently I'm using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> to design circuit boards that will fly on HuskySat-2. Here's a photograph of a radio board I designed (based heavily on <a href="https://github.com/OpenLST/openlst">OpenLST</a>), as well as a video I made about magnetorquers:</p>

<p>Some relevant courses I've taken at the University of Washington include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Foundations of Computing</strong> - Here I learned the theoretical math underlying various aspects of computer science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software Design And Implementation</strong> - Here I created multiple fullstack typescript projects, using the best practices in version control, testing, and modularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Structures and Parallelism</strong> - This course covered parallelism and data structures through the lens of time complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems Programming</strong> - In this course I gained experience writing low-level C++ projects. I learned the ins-and-outs of system calls and memory management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hardware/Software Interface</strong> - Here I learned to use gdb, read assembly, and understand memory layout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction to Digital Design</strong> - Here I made a snake game on an FPGA, by writing a multi-file system verilog program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> - Here I used PyTorch and Numpy to implement algorithms such as LASSO regression, stochastic gradient descent, and backpropagation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Book Recommendations</h2>
<p>All of these books have helped me understand the forest instead of just seeing the trees.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722">The Righteous Mind</a> - Jonathan Haidt, Simona Drelciuc</h3>
<p>Humans have evolved a gut feeling to judge things as moral or immoral.
How does our moral compass work, and what evolutionary purpose does it serve?
How does it fuel varying political views?</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook">The Dictator's Handbook</a> - Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith</h3>
<p>Why do countries with more natural resources tend to have lower standards of living? Why are some countries rich and others poor? What prevents democracies from turning into dictatorships?</p>
<p>World events are often explained by analyzing the ideologies and beliefs of countries. I find this unconvincing. I mean, what does it mean for an abstract entity called a country to have motives, ideas, and thoughts?</p>
<p>This book takes a very different approach, and explains the structure of power through the lens of game theory.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39644188">Order Without Design</a> - Alain Bertaud</h3>
<p>Cities spontaneously form because living closer to others allows the efficient exchange of labor, goods, and ideas. What factors and incentives influence things like population density, building height, and housing costs? Why are cities in different countries so different? How do government attempts to regulate how cities grow influence their structure? Read this book to find out!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1909043">Negotiation Genius</a> - Deepak Malhotra, Max H. Bazerman</h3>
<p>Two parties with different goals, motives, and incentives, come to the negotiation table. How can they come to a mutually beneficial agreement?</p>
<p>This book derives a comprehensive framework for analyzing negotiations and creating shared value that benefits both parties. The art of negotiation is so much more than just back-and-forth haggling.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50878951">How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor</a> - Colin Tucker</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how a nuclear reactor works? How do they reliably and safely satisfy over 10% of the world's electricity needs? This book, written by a reactor operator, strikes the perfect balance between dumbed-down and too-technical.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3028">Economics in One Lesson</a> - Henry Hazlitt</h3>
<p>Disclaimer: This book doesn't teach economic analysis.
Written in 1946, it's a rant against certain economic policies.
Treat this book with a large grain of salt, because unlike the others listed here, it's quite one-sided.</p>
<p>That said, I recommend reading it to develop a well-rounded understanding of the reasoning behind free market economics.
It makes thought-provoking arguments against certain forms of government intervention.
Read it with an open mind, and you'll have a lot to think about!</p>
